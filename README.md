# Cesar-and-Polybius-square-cryptography-Python

This is a project I had fun making as a school project and said to my self why not to start with it my github journey

The project written in pure python to crypt and decrypt Cesar and Polybius square cryptography methods.

If you find this helpful give it a star and have fun modifing it.

Rq : the python code may not be optimised so dont blame me.
